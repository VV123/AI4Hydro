# Spatio-temporal Models (including baselines)

- GraphWaveNet
  
    GraphWavenet combines graph convolution and dilated causal convolution to effectively model spatial-temporal dependencies. It employs      a directed graph with a "transition" adjacency matrix, which is designed to ensure the fairness of the representation across     
    different nodes.
  
- STGCN

    Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) integrates graph convolution with 2D convolution to simultaneously capture 
    spatial and temporal correlations. This approach has proven effective in modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as those 
    found in traffic systems and social networks, thereby providing a robust framework for predictive analysis in these domains.

- STSSL
  
     Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (STSSL), which addresses the challenge of missing values in spatio-temporal datasets. This 
     self-supervised learning approach is particularly adept at learning underlying spatio-temporal features, thereby facilitating improved
     performance in the subsequent supervised learning task.
